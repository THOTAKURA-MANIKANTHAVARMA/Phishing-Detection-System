# Phishing-Detection-System
Phishing detection is the process of identifying fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal data by disguising as a trustworthy entity via email, messages, or fake websites. Effective phishing detection helps protect individuals and organizations from data breaches, financial loss, and identity theft. Always verify the source before clicking links, avoid sharing confidential information through unsolicited messages, and report suspicious activity. Awareness is the first step to defense.
